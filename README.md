# CSCI 571 Spring 2020

Web Technologies is a course that focussed all the way from the basic understanding of the world wide web(WWW) and the internet concepts to building and developing latest trending languages and libraries like React.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, Android etc.

I started with learning the basics of web development languages: Html and CSS. After which, I understood the concepts of JSON and JSON Parsing. This followed the concepts of a client-server architechture and the REST Api functionality. Client side technologies like AJAX(Asynchrounous JavScript & XML), Bootstrap and Javascript frameworks like React.js were introduced. While latest Server side programming like Node.js, Flask, Django were used. Serverless Architechture like AWS, GCP,AZURe CLoud were taught. Lastly, I worked on the implementaion on an Android Application.

## Assignment 3
The first homework in the CSCI Web Technologies course taught at USC. We were suppossed to construct a very basic static site based only on HTML , CSS technologies.

## Assignment 4
This assignmnet focussed on using JSON technology. We were suppossed to parse a JSON file and display the information in a tabular format using html and JavaScript. There were various error cases that we had to take care of out here.

## Assignment 6
This assessment required us to use any of the latest python frameworks i.e. Django/Flask to serve as a website backend. We used google news API to get details of the latest trending news. There was a search functionality embedded which allowed users to search for a particular topic of their interest. Finally, this entire Web-app was hosted on AWS services.

## Assignment 8
This was a comprehensive homework of the course. I built a site using node.js technology for backend. In this Webapp I used the Guardian and the New York Times API to get the trending news. React.js and Bootstrap technologies were used to build various components of the website like the search bar, the favourites page etc. The users could comment on each post using the comment-box API. The search functionality had the bing AutoSuggest API which helped in dynamically getting results based on the letters typed. Due to Bootstrap, this became a responsive website which would automatically scale to device-width be it a Mobile, Tablet or a Desktop. This Application was hosted on Google Cloud Platform(GCP).

## Assignment 9
This assignment was the android version of Assignment 8. With the same functionalities and the same Node.js backend, I replicated Assignment 8 as an Android App.
